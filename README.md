## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a version of node that is at 16 or past it. If you do not go to this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and click on the version recommended for most users. Ensure that you have the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed - the development environment is set up in Docker. Also make sure that you have an IDE like Visual Studio Code so that you can edit if you want to!

### Installing

In your terminal type these steps in to get the code running - note that you may have to run Docker Desktop to get the Docker Daemon running:

```
git clone https://github.com/nashvador/RedditCloneBackend.git
cd RedditCloneBackend
npm install
docker-compose up
```

## Running Tests

Before running your tests make sure that you have all the prerequisites and have ran `npm install` prior to everything.

###

To run your tests do `npm run test`. The test should work on atleast the chromium browsers.
